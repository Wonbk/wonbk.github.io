## What is Javascript?

Javascript is a scripting or programming language that allows you implement complex features on web pages. Implementing Javascript makes a web page more dynamic instead of just displaying static information. Examples include displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, photo slideshows,  scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.

## The Power of 3

There are three main elements that form the backbone of web development. That is HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

- **HTML** is the structure of your page - the headers, body text, any images you want to include.
- **CSS** controls how that page looks such as customizing fonts, background colors, etc.
- **Javascript** is the magic third element. Once you've created your structure (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe (CSS), Javascript makes your web page dynamic.

## What can Javascript do?
We all know that Javascript turns your static web page of text into a functional dynamic web page. But it not just limited to front-end development. Javascript is also used for:

- **Developing mobile applications** - it is used to create those apps you have on your phone or tablet as well.

- **Creating web browser based games** - it is used to create web browser games.

- **Back-end web development** - Javascript is mostly used for fron-end developing but it's a versatile enough scripting language to be used on back end infrastructure too


Example for simple text label:

After adding CSS:
```
p {
     font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;
     letter-spacing: 1px;
     text-transform: uppercase;
     text-align: center;
     border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
     background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);
     color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
     box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);
     border-radius: 10px;
     padding: 3px 10px;
     display: inline-block;
     cursor: pointer;
   }
```
we get this:

<img class="ui medium image" src="../images/player 1.png">
