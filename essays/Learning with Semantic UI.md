# **What is a UI framework?**

A UI framework (User-Interface framework) is a frame with software tools to help you build your software. This includes things like tool sets, code libraries, Application Programming Interfaces (API). This means if you were a developer and had deadlines for your projects, by using a UI framework, it would help build your software quicker and more efficiently. This sure does make development life easier. But sometimes that may not be the case. You would have to learn all the nuances of the framework to be able to benefit from it. In my software engineering class, our task was to recreate a website to the best of our abilities using a framework called Semantic Ui. Up until this point, I have never written any sort of code with HTML, CSS, Javascript before. This was all new to me. I'd like to think that learning HTML along side Semantic UI has helped me grasped the concepts quicker.
