To begin the game, first run the program. The game starts with "X" player first. To choose your mark, you have to type in the coordinates on the displayed grid. It goes by 'X' and 'Y' coordinates. For example if you typed in "0 1", it will place a mark on the pos01 position. This goes on until either player wins or draw.
