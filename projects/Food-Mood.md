## **Initial Startup**
For our final project in ICS 314, we had to develop a web application that utilizes resources from UH Manoa and that students can use on campus. Ideas ranged from UH Manoa textbook exchange to UH Manoa carpool system. My development team and I chose the idea of UH Manoa food vendors. From there, we made the initial mockup pages of the landing page, food listings, food options, favorites, vendors, reviews, etc.
